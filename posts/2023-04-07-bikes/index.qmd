Manila is the densest city on Earth,^[Other sources may differ depending on how city boundaries are defined.] fitting 1.8 million people into a 43 square-kilometer crucible. The 16 other cities that constitute Metro Manila, the Philippine capital, are extraordinarily crowded as well, resulting in an overall density of 22,000/kmÂ². This is twice that of New York and almost three times that of Singapore. Dysfunctional urban planning has failed to cope. Suburbs-style neighborhoods and private golf courses [sprawl incongruously](https://twitter.com/pfkahanapINQ/status/1605847613089058816) in city centers while open green spaces [remain limited](https://manilastandard.net/spotlight/ms-36th-anniversary-issue-towards-a-sustainable-future/314303715/claiming-back-the-city.html).
