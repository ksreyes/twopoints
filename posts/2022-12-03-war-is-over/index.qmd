People's feelings about the Christmas season span a wide range, from very positive to very negative. As for where I fall, well:

    type_of_conflict = factor(type_of_conflict),

    count = ifelse(!(ep_end_date > xmas), 0, 1)
  ) %>%

conflicts <- df %>%

  ungroup()

ggplot(conflicts, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = type_of_conflict)) +

    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, margin = margin(t = 5)),

  )
```

The data is from the [UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset](https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/index.html). I'll go through how I constructed the above chart.

First, some words about the dataset. Each observation is a conflict-year. A conflict is dated from its first battle-related death, but only active "episodes" --- defined as 25 battle-related deaths --- are recorded in the database. For example, the Basque conflict has the following entries:

```{r}
here::here("datasets", "ucdp-prio-acd-221.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  select(conflict_id, side_a, side_b, year, start_date, start_date2, ep_end_date) %>%
  filter(conflict_id == "342") %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "c")
```

While it is recorded as starting on 7 June 1968, its first active episode started on 22 October 1978 and lasted until 29 December 1982. A second episode occurred from 23 December 1985 to 31 December 1987, then a third from 28 June to 13 December 1991. For my purposes, this would count as an active conflict for the Christmas Days of 1978-1982 and 1985-1987. Not 1991 however, since that episode ended right before Christmas.

For each conflict-year, I therefore need to construct a dummy to indicate whether it is a Christmas conflict or not. I do it in three steps. First, I construct the variable `xmas` to set the Christmas Day for each year. Second, I set the variable `count` to 0 if the conflict-year's `ep_end_date` occurs before Christmas. Finally, for all cases where `ep_end_date` is NA, I set `count` to 1.

```{r}
df <- here::here("datasets", "ucdp-prio-acd-221.csv") %>%
  read_csv() %>%
  mutate(
    xmas = as.Date(paste0(year, "-12-25")),
    count = ifelse(!(ep_end_date > xmas), 0, 1)
  ) %>%
  replace_na(list(count = 1))
```

Then it's a simple matter of counting the active conflicts per year and constructing a bar chart. to illustrate the depressing fact that Christmas 2021 saw an all-time high in active conflicts worldwide.

To end, here's the song that inspired this post. Have a bad Christmas season everybody. `r end_mark()`
