My name is Ken.\n\nI work a lot with data, which means I often engage in the fun, frustrating, highly consequential—yet frequently dismissed!—art of data visualization.\nTwo Points Make a Line documents my journey in mastering this art. I share my thoughts on what makes a chart work and what doesn’t, the tools I use, and the jambalaya of tidbits I learn along the way. Enjoy!\nReach me at kenneth.rejes@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n\n",
