My name is Ken.\r\nI work a lot with data, which means I often engage in the fun, frustrating, highly consequential—yet frequently dismissed!—art of data visualization.\r\nTwo Points Make a Line documents my journey in mastering this art. I share my thoughts on what makes a chart work and what doesn’t, the tools I use for chart-crafting, and the jambalaya of tidbits I learn along the way.\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
