Hello! My name is Ken. 

I work a lot with [data](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ksreyes/), which means I often engage in the fun, frustrating, highly consequential---yet frequently dismissed!---art of data visualization. 

*Two Points Make a Line* documents my journey in mastering this art. I share my thoughts on what makes a chart work and what doesn't, the tools I use for chart-crafting, and the jambalaya of tidbits I learn along the way.

Enjoy!
