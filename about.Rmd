Hello! My name is Ken.
</p>

I work a lot with data, which means I often engage in the fun, frustrating, highly consequential---yet frequently dismissed!---art of data visualization. 

*Two Points Make a Line* documents my journey in mastering this art. I take an interesting dataset and tell a story about it using charts. Along the way, I share my thoughts on what makes a chart work and what doesn't, the tools I use, and other tidbits. Enjoy!
