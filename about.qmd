I work a lot with data, which means I often engage in the fun, frustrating, highly consequential---yet frequently dismissed!---art of data visualization.

<span class="inline">Two Points Make a Line</span> documents my journey in mastering this art. I take an interesting dataset and tell a story about it using charts. Along the way, I share my thoughts on what makes a chart work and what doesn't, the tools I use, and other tidbits. Enjoy!
